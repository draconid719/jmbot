"A moving average helps cut down the amount of \"noise\" on a price chart. "
"Look at the \n"
"        direction of the moving average to get\n"
" a basic idea of which way the price is moving. If it is angled up, \n"
"        the price is moving up (or was recently) overall; angled down, and "
"the\n"
" price is moving down overall; \n"
"        moving sideways, and the price is likely in a range. \n"
"\n"
"        A moving average can also act as support or resistance. In an "
"uptrend, a 50-day, 100-day or 200-day \n"
"        moving average may act as a support\n"
" level, as shown in the figure below. This is because the average \n"
"        acts like a floor (support), so the price bounces up off of it. In "
"a\n"
" downtrend, a moving average may \n"
"        act as resistance; like a ceiling, the price hits the level and then "
"starts to drop again. \n"
"\n"
"        The price won't always \"respect\" the moving average in this way. "
"The price may run through it slightly or \n"
"        stop and reverse prior to reaching it. \n"
"\n"
"        As a general guideline, if the price is above a moving average, the "
"trend is up. If the price is below a \n"
"        moving average, the trend is down. However,\n"
" moving averages can have different lengths (discussed \n"
"        shortly), so one MA may indicate an uptrend while another MA "
"indicates a downtrend. "
